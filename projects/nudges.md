# Nudges

## Description

Nudges is a simple reminders app that won't induce guilt.

Grayson and I built an initial version of this last year to coincide with the iOS 7 release, but haven't really worked on it in the last year since we got it into the App Store.

In order to learn about Swift and new iOS 8 APIs, we're going to re-write Nudges completely using Swift/CloudKit.
