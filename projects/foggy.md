### July 25

A lot of getting to know SpriteKit particles and SKFieldNodes. Setting strange regions with constructive set geometry seems to work very well. Am hoping for more Swift-specific illumination to share in future updates -- although I will say not having .h and .m files vying for pixels on my 13" mpb is an insufficiently sung feature.

So: My wife hates snowboarding because she's a good skier. She's far sportier than me, and no doubt would be a much better snowboarder if she gave it a fair shake, but she just hates being a noob on the hill. I don't downhill ski, so this never bothered me.

I've been having a hard time with Swift recently. Flaky debugger, scant documentation, and constant struggle trying to write 'nice Swift'. I feel like every time I invest a serious stretch of time into trying to advance my summer project, I end up getting caught up in minutia, trying to find a 'nice' way to accomplish something I already know how to do. 

I think what helped me last night was to stop trying so hard. I am a beginner. There's a lot I don't know. It's hubristic to shoot for elegance when I don't have the experience to back up that desire. It's a particular trap because the markers of elegance that I'm used to, the tell-tales of craftmanship that signify competence in Objective-C might be completely wrong in Swift, and I'm spending a lot of fruitless time trying to literally reimplement them in this new language.

Realizing this made me feel a lot better. It's a balance, but I'm going to embrace my inner spaghetti code monster. Time to write some bad code.

Just as a footnote to the aether... One of the things that scared the pants off me about Swift was the fact that it represented a break from the truly remarkable community and best practices that surround Objective-C. I'm afraid of developers that weren't weaned on Aaron Hillegass. I wonder if this fear is part of the push towards identifying 'nice' (or 'idiomatic', 'pure' or 'elegant') Swift. But in any case, I think it will do a world a good to let it go. It's too early. I certainly need to spend more time accumulating scrapes in the playground first.
