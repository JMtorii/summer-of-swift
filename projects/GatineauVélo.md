# GatineauVélo

## Description

[https://github.com/philippec/GatineauVelo](This application) displays the bike paths for the City of Gatineau, and makes a good sample app for test-driven development. 

I'd like to rewrite it in Swift to compare and contrast, as the original was built in only a few hours.
