# Boris the Blade

## Description

Framework for using [Xcode Playgrounds][1] in your own app. 

First of all, it would be really awesome to have Playgrounds inside your presentation software to execute live code, similar to what [showoff][4] already does for JS and Ruby. 

Second reason for doing this is exploring how the more dynamic parts of the Objective-C runtime can effectively be used in Swift and what features might not work at this point.

## Updates

### July 7

First minimal version of this was done during SwiftCrunch. The framework works to the point of opening the Playgrounds editor inside any app, but crashes when typing because SourceKit isn't properly set up, yet.
