# Crump

## Description

Crump is an arcade game with 80s style play based around OS X, keyboard input, tmx (Tiled) tile maps, and SpriteKit.  The exact details of the gameplay are still a work in progress but enemy avoidance, constant movement withn a grid, and collection will be its essential elements.

I've gotten the open source JSTileMap library to work with Swift using Obj-C interop.  I'm using it to read .tmx Tile maps created with the open source editor Tiled.  I also discovered, along with the author of the JSTileMap library, a bug in Apple's PNG library on OS X that doesn't exist on iOS. It is related to the size of a particular PNG being miscalculated. For more details, you can read through this issue:

I have started a basic level and have learned to use Tiled along with JSTileMap.
