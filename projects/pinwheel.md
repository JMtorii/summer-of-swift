# Pinwheel

## Description

I've just started working on a fully-functional Pinboard client for iPhone and iPad. This project aims to include a Safari / System Extension that will allow sending URLs from other apps to your Pinboard account.

I'm going lone-wolf on this one (the way I like it) and I aim to learn a great deal about Swift and the latest offerings provided by iOS 8. It'll include a full (and likely separate) API adapter for the Pinboard REST API as well (hopefully useable by others as a CocoaPod).

## Project Location

It will live at https://github.com/kreeger/pinwheel.
