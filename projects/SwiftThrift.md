# SwiftThrift

## Description

Implementation of Swift target language for the [Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org) message serialization library. This project consists of 2 parts:

- a runtime for message serialization and RPC, written in Swift
- a code generator for emitting Swift code from a Thrift IDL, written in C++

My intention is to get this merged into either Apache's Thrift project or Facebook's fork.
