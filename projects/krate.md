# Krate - Create and Destroy

## Description

Krate is a fresh twist on gem puzzle games, featuring a spinning board; creeping evil, powerful combos and tough choices.  Most of all, my goal is that Krate will entertain and reward players.

This is my summer Swift learning project, born through the fortuitous coincidence of the Swift announcement with the Spring semesterâ€™s end.
