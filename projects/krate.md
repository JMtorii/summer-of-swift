# Krate - Create and Destroy

## Description

Krate is a fresh twist on gem puzzle games, featuring a spinning board; creeping evil, powerful combos and tough choices.  Most of all, my goal is that Krate will entertain and reward players.

This is my summer Swift learning project, born through the fortuitous coincidence of the Swift announcement with the Spring semesterâ€™s end.

## Updates

### July 8th
Basic gameplay mechanics implemented with colorful blocks!

### July 10
Krate saw terrific advancement this week!  [I wrote a summary of work here.](http://www.thinkingswiftly.com/krate-advancing-leaps-bounds/)

**Quick updates list:**
- Placeholder graphics
- Sound management system (with some placeholders)
- I created a [Backbone.js style events manager for Swift](https://github.com/StephenHaney/Swift-Custom-Events) (Please check it out and help make it better!)
- Added many new game mechanics

It'll be hard to match this pace in the future, but I'm happy with what was accomplished.
