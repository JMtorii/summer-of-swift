### July 25

The project has begun!

I've created the initial game scaffold using Xcode's new Sprite Kit project layout.

Basic gameplay is functional.  You can tap only on the ball to cause it to move upwards in the scene.

We're also calculating where inside the ball you touched and using that when calculating the impulse vector to apply to the ball.

Also moving away from the .sks file and towards pure code implemenation of the game.
