Summer of Swift
===============

_An Ephemeral Contest to Learn Swift by Doing_


### What is it?

The Summer of Swift came from conversations at the [Swift Language User Group](http://www.meetup.com/swift-language) in San Francisco. The idea is that many developers learn by practice, and especially by building big apps. In essence, the Summer is just trying to provide objectives and a framework to motivate developers around the world to build a Swift app this Summer.


### How does it work?

Participants in the Summer work alone or in teams. To enter, just send a pull request to this repo to add a file to the `projects/` folder. That file should follow the template in [`projects/TEMPLATE.md`](projects/TEMPLATE.md). Your pull request should also add an entry to the “[Big Board](#the-big-board)” section below.

**_The only rule of the Summer of Swift is that you must edit your project file at least once every 2 weeks with an update on your progress & what you have learned so far. Teams who fail to do so will be crossed off from the “Big Board”._**

If your update falls around one of the [SLUG](http://www.meetup.com/swift-language) meetups, we encourage you to give your update in person — we’ll give every participating team a 5-minute lightning talk to demo their progress & share what they’ve learned at every meetup. If you cannot make it in person, you should share your progress on your blog, github, twitter, youtube etc. We’ll aggregate all the updates done at the SLUG and share them on YouTube.

The contest will run until September 30th and will conclude with a 2-hour meetup in San Francisco entirely devoted to the teams that toughed it out through the Summer. They will show off their apps and summarize all that they have learned about Swift over the Summer. The event will be recorded and shared on YouTube.

### What can I work on?

Anything you want that helps you deepen your understanding of Swift: apps, games, libraries, tooling, documentation — anything is fair!

### That bi-monthly update requirement sounds rough!

The bi-monthly update requirement is just there to encourage people to stay engaged and stick with their Swift project over a meaningful period of time. We understand that people have work, vacation, family and other things that may not let them adhere to an agressive learning schedule! Any of the following would be a good update
- Github push to your repo
- Blogpost about something you have learned so far
- Video or tech talk you’ve given about your app

We’ll accept any other signs of life from participants :)

### Are there any prizes?

If you’re interested in offering prizes, motivators or help (books, online courses, etc.) to the contestants in the Summer of Swift, please email arwa@realm.io. Above all the Summer is about learning, so prizes may not be a good fit, but we do understand that sometimes motivators help ;) At the very least, you’ll get bragging rights and an eternity of posterity by being one of the few names not crossed off [The Big Board](#the-big-board).

### Sounds great! How do I enter?

1. Send a pull request to this repo. Your PR must add a file with your project name to the `projects/` folder, following the template in `projects/TEMPLATE.md` + adding an entry to the “[Big Board](#the-big-board)” section below.
2. (Optional) Register for the [mailing-list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/summer-of-swift) so you can share & receive project updates from others, hear about any upcoming Summer hacknights or prizes, or ask for help.

### I don’t have a project / can I join a project?

Yes, you can submit PRs requesting to add yourself to an existing team. We’ll ask the original submitter(s) to :+1: it before merging it in.

### Can we meet somewhere to work on this together?

Absolutely, based on demand, we’ll organize hacknights in San Francisco & Silicon Valley, devoted to hacking on these projects. If you can host something like this in the Bay area on a regular basis please email arwa@realm.io.

### Do I have to be in San Francisco this Summer to enter?

No, you can compete from anywhere as long as you send updates to this repo regularly.

If you host a Swift meetup in another city and would like to host regular lightning talks or hacknights for Summer contestants, let arwa@realm.io know and we’ll add you to this page so people know!

### I have another question — who can I contact?

Reach out to Arwa \<arwa@realm.io\> and Tim \<tim@realm.io\>

# The Big Board

This is the list of all the teams that have entered. Teams that are crossed off missed at least one bi-monthly update.
