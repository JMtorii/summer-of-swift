Summer of Swift
===============

_An Ephemeral Contest to Learn Swift by Doing_


### What is it?

The Summer of Swift came from conversations at the [Swift Language User Group](http://www.meetup.com/swift-language) in San Francisco. The idea is that many developers learn by practice, and especially by building big apps. In essence, the Summer is just trying to provide objectives and a framework to motivate all developers build a Swift app this Summer.


### How does it work?

Participants in the Summer work alone or in teams. To enter, just send a pull request to this repo to add a file to the `projects/` folder. That file must follow the template in `projects/TEMPLATE.md`. Your pull request should also add an entry to the “Big Board” section below.

**_The only rule of the Summer of Swift is that you must update this file at least once every 2 weeks with an update on your progress. Teams who fail to do so will be crossed off from the “Big Board”._**

If your update falls around one of the [SLUG](http://www.meetup.com/swift-language) meetups, we encourage you to give your update in person — we’ll give every participating team a 5-minute lightning talk to demo their progress & share what they’ve learned. If you cannot make it in person, you should share your progress on your blog, github, twitter, youtube etc. We’ll aggregate all the updates and share them with the group.

The contest will run until September 30th with a 2-hour meetup devoted a retrospective with all the teams that toughed it out through the Summer. They will show off their apps and summarize all that they have learned about Swift over the Summer.

### What can I work on?

Anything you want that helps you deepen your understanding of Swift: apps, games, libraries, tooling, documentation — anything is fair!

### That bimonthly update requirement sounds rough!

The bi-monthly update requirement is just there to encourage people to stay engaged and stick with their Swift project over a meaningful period of time. We understand that people have work, vacation, kids and other commitments that can get in the way of learning! Any of the following would be a good update
- Github push to your repo
- Blogpost about something you have learned so far
- Video or tech talk you’ve given about your app

We’ll accept any other signs of life from participants :)

### Are there any prizes?

If you’re interested in offering prizes, motivators or help (books, online courses, etc.) to the contestants in the Summer of Swift, please email arwa@realm.io. Above all the Summer is about learning, so prizes may not be a good fit, but we do understand that sometimes motivators help ;)

### Sounds great! How do I enter?

Send a pull request to this repo. Your PR must add a file with your project name to the `projects/` folder, following the template in `projects/TEMPLATE.md` + adding an entry to the “Big Board” section below.

### I don’t have a project / can I join a project?

Yes, you can submit PRs requesting to add yourself to an existing team. We’ll ask the original submitter(s) to :+1: it before merging it in.

### Can we meet somewhere to work on this together?

Absolutely, based on demand, we’ll organize hacknights in San Francisco & Silicon Valley, devoted to hacking on these projects. If you can host something like this in the Bay area on a regular basis please email arwa@realm.io.

### Do I have to be in San Francisco this Summer to enter?

No, you can compete from anywhere as long as you give us updates regularly. If you host a Swift meetup in another city and would like to host regular lightning talks by contestants, let us know and we’ll add you to this page to let people know!

### I have another question — who can I contact?

Reach out to Arwa \<arwa@realm.io\> and Tim \<tim@realm.io\>
